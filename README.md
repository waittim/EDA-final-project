# H1B Visa Application Analysis

**Source**
The datasets are from the [Department of Labor's](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm#dis) website.

[H-1B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa) visa is a visa in the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act, section 101(a)(15)(H) that allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. A specialty occupation requires the application of specialized knowledge and a bachelor’s degree or the equivalent of work experience. 

**Data**
The H-1B Dataset selected for this project contains data from employer’s Labor Condition Application and the case certification determinations processed by the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC). 

The Labor Condition Application (LCA) is a document that a perspective H-1B employer files with U.S. Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration (DOLETA) when it seeks to employ non-immigrant workers at a specific job occupation in an area of intended employment for not more than three years. 

For our analysis, we will be looking at only the 2018 dataset.
